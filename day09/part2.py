Approach:
- convert line in a list of "run" tuples each describing
  the file id, run start position and run length (file id='.' for gaps).
- for each file run starting from the right:
  - find the first gap run large enough to fit the file, starting from the left
  - if no gap is found, continue to the next file
  - if a gap large enough was found, reduce the size of the gap (or delete it)
    and insert the file before it
